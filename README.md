LAB 1

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The purpose of this lab was to explore various topics within IT such as the history of computing and how to use platforms such as GitHub. IT 1025 covers a wide range of topics. The main goal is to increase student awareness of the various topics so that they may then go on to more advanced computer and IT topics.  The history of IT was provided through a couple of YouTube videos the instructor assigned. One was on Charles Babbage the father of the computer and video on the history of IBM. GitHub is a platform that allows students to learn different topics such as programming and icloud storage.

CONCLUSION

Through the use of this lab we were introduced to some basic requirements of IT 1025. We also were introduced to client-server architecture and GitHub. GitHub is interesting. I played around with it 12 days ago but never submitted anything to my regret. We then had a to go to Dayton and get my mother-in-law who is now staying with us so she can have a surgery tomorrow at UH Main Campus with Dr. Becthle. I found gitHub originally interesting but a little difficult to figure out when I returned to finish up this assignment for submission late. I look forward to learning more about topics like this one though as they will be useful at work. I want to eventually move into an IT position there and using the topics we learn from this course will help with that. GitHub is a useful tool to experiment with. I found examples of submissions by past students and found those very helpful in working on this.
